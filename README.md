mileage expense app
Track gas mileage, oil change notification, monthly mileage. Plan to support Apple Watch support for displaying
odometer reading when at the pump. The user will start a new entry in the vehicle, enter the odometer, then when 
at the pump, they will be able to view the watch and see their odometer and driver ID (fuel card PIN).
This functionality is needed for anybody that uses a company vehicle.

When the user gets back in the vehicle, they can take a photo of their receipt and enter in gallons pumped and
even fuel price. These last actions will be optional because not everyone wants to track all of that information.

That's my thoughts on the app for now. EVERYTHING is subject to change.
